# About This Project
This project is based on a small python tool that can encrypt and decrypt any password with its own Caesar-style encryption system.

This runs graphically on top of a TKinter layer, but it's just to make the tool more intuitive. If you wish you can use the Console version:
-> in the ```main.py``` file:

- Comment the line that executes the ```gui()``` and then uncomment the ```app()``` line.
